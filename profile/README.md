# ✨ Signius

**Freelance development studio building tools for open-source communities, blockchain ecosystems, and governance automation.**

## 👋 About Signius

Signius is the freelance software studio of André Diamond — a full-stack developer deeply embedded in Web3 and open-source ecosystems. I build specialized tools for community coordination, treasury governance, and infrastructure automation across blockchain networks like **Cardano** and **SingularityNET**.

Whether you're running a DAO, building a governance dashboard, or tracking your community’s metrics — I help projects scale with clarity, transparency, and developer-first tooling.

## 🔧 What I Build

Signius delivers production-ready tools that prioritize transparency, decentralization, and usability. My work spans:

### 🧱 Governance & Treasury Automation
- On-chain proposal tracking and dashboards
- GitHub-powered workflows for Project Boards
- Treasury and consent tooling with voting tokens and influence weights

### 📊 Ecosystem Dashboards
- Real-time metrics for GitHub repos, Discord communities, and blockchain protocols
- Custom background APIs and integrations (Koios, Supabase, Netlify, Zoom, Discord)
- Scheduled scripts via GitHub Actions and cron-powered insights

### 🛠️ Developer Infrastructure
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript monorepos with clean architecture
- Supabase (RLS, GraphQL, Edge Functions), MeshJS SDK, and Netlify background functions
- GitHub Actions for automation, data fetching, and deployment pipelines

## 🌍 Who I Build For

I’ve worked with and built tools for communities including:

- **Cardano** — governance dashboards, Catalyst insights, MeshJS SDK usage analytics
- **SingularityNET** — tooling for the Ambassador Program - Treasury Guild, and Archives Workgroup
- **Open-source Communities** — public dashboards and bots that turn governance into code

If you're building something that supports collective action, I want to help you ship it.

## 🧠 Philosophy

- 🧑‍💻 **Code is collaboration** — clean, documented infrastructure makes it easy to grow.
- 🔍 **Governance should be legible** — I build systems that show who did what, when, and why.
- 🤖 **Automation matters** — GitHub Actions, bots, and CRON jobs are part of every workflow.

---

## 🧰 Projects

Some of my current and past work includes:

- **Governance Dashboards** — full-stack dashboards for Cardano governance, DRep votes, Catalyst and SPO data
- **Cardano Dashboard** — visualizing activity across treasury, SPOs, GitHub repos and more
- **Discord and Github Stats Trackers** — member/message analytics, Member GitHub commits etc
- **Treasury Tools** — transaction builder that integrates directly with community-maintained spreadsheets, enabling metadata-infused transactions and real-time dashboards.
